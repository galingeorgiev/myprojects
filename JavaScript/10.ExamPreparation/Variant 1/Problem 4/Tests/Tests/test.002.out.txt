The  history of
bullets     far
predates    the
history      of
firearms
Originally
bullets    were
metallic  stone
or  purposemade
clay balls used
as        sling
ammunition   as
weapons and for
hunting
Eventually   as
firearms   were
developed these
same items were
placed in front
of a propellant
charge       of
gunpowder    at
the  end  of  a
closed  tube As
firearms became
more
technologically
advanced   from
to      bullets
changed    very
little     They
remained simple
round spherical
lead      balls
called   rounds
differing  only
in        their
diameter
Matchlock
musket    balls
alleged to have
been discovered
at       Naseby
battlefield
From        the
collection   of
Night   of  the
Museum  and Art
Gallery     The
development  of
the        hand
culverin    and
matchlock
arquebus
brought   about
the use of cast
lead  balls  as
projectiles
Bullet       is
derived    from
the French word
boulette  which
roughly   means
little ball The
original musket
bullet   was  a
spherical  lead
ball    smaller
than  the  bore
wrapped   in  a
loosely  fitted
paper     patch
which served to
hold the bullet
in  the  barrel
firmly upon the
powder  Bullets
that  were  not
firmly upon the
powder     upon
firing   risked
causing     the
barrel       to
explode    with
the   condition
known    as   a
short start The
loading      of
muskets     was
therefore  easy
with   the  old
smoothbore
Brown  Bess and
similar
military
muskets     The
original
muzzleloading
rifle   on  the
other hand with
a  more closely
fitting ball to
take        the
rifling grooves
was        more
difficult    to
load
particularly
when  the  bore
of  the  barrel
was fouled from
previous
firings     For
this     reason
early    rifles
were        not
generally  used
for    military
purposes    The
first  half  of
the  nineteenth
century  saw  a
distinct change
in   the  shape
and function of
the  bullet  In
Delvigne      a
French infantry
officer
invented      a
breech     with
abrupt
shoulders    on
which         a
spherical
bullet      was
rammed     down
until it caught
the     rifling
grooves
Delvignes
method  however
deformed    the
bullet  and was
inaccurate
