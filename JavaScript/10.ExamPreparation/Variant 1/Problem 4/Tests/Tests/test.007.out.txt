DriveFreeZ  is an opensource
driving simulator recreating
the traffic conditions every
driver  experiences  on  the
road  Its primary goal is to
serve  as  a simulation tool
for  experts working on road
safety as well as to provide
an   educational   tool  for
novice  traffic participants
The  project takes advantage
of    modern   methods   for
objectoriented   programming
data       storage       and
optimization       processes
advanced    platforms    for
building  the  layout of the
city  The flexibility of the
code  permits  developers to
modify  it  and  use  it  in
their  own  work Development
by the authors is constantly
underway    extending    and
improving    the    projects
functionality  The  graphics
and  physics  cores  of  the
application    provide   the
realism  of  the surrounding
world            DriveFreeZs
development  concentrates on
simulating the technical and
physical  aspects of vehicle
movement   as  well  as  the
mental  aspects  of  drivers
interaction  resulting  in a
highly   satisfying  driving
simulation           product
