Curricula  defined computing as In a
general  way we can define computing
to  mean  any  goaloriented activity

creating  computers  Thus  computing
includes   designing   and  building
hardware  and software systems for a
wide  range  of  purposes processing

Computing  Curricula also recognizes
that   the   meaning   of  computing
depends  on  the  context  Computing
also  has  other  meanings  that are
more  specific  based on the context
in   which  the  term  is  used  For
example   an   information   systems
specialist   will   view   computing
somewhat differently from a software
engineer  Regardless  of the context
doing    computing   well   can   be
complicated  and  difficult  Because
society needs people to do computing
well  we must think of computing not
only  as  a profession but also as a
discipline  The  term  computing has
sometimes  been  narrowly defined as

Discipline    The    discipline   of
computing is the systematic study of
algorithmic  processes that describe

terms  A  computer is a machine that
manipulates  data according to a set
of  instructions  called  a computer
program    The    program   has   an
executable  form  that  the computer
can  use  directly  to  execute  the
instructions The same program in its
humanreadable   source   code   form
enables  a  programmer  to study and
develop  the  algorithm  Because the
instructions  can  be carried out in
different   types   of  computers  a
single  set  of  source instructions
converts   to  machine  instructions
according  to the central processing
unit   type  The  execution  process
carries  out  the  instructions in a
computer     program    Instructions
express  the  computations performed

hardware  Computer  software or just
software is a collection of computer
programs   and   related  data  that
provides    the   instructions   for
telling  a  computer  what to do and
how  to do it Software refers to one
or  more  computer programs and data
held  in the storage of the computer
for  some  purposes  In  other words
software   is   a  set  of  programs
procedures    algorithms   and   its
documentation   concerned  with  the
operation   of   a  data  processing
system Program software performs the
function    of    the   program   it
implements    either   by   directly
providing    instructions   to   the
computer  hardware  or by serving as
input  to  another piece of software
The  term  was coined to contrast to
the   old   term   hardware  meaning
physical   devices  In  contrast  to
hardware  software cannot be touched
Software is also sometimes used in a
more     narrow     sense    meaning
application  software only Sometimes
the  term includes data that has not
traditionally  been  associated with
computers  such  as  film  tapes and

an application or an app is computer
software  designed  to help the user
to  perform  specific tasks Examples
include      enterprise     software
accounting  software  office  suites
graphics  software and media players
Many   application   programs   deal
principally  with documents Apps may
be bundled with the computer and its
system  software or may be published
separately  Some users are satisfied
with the bundled apps and need never
install  one Application software is
contrasted  with system software and
middleware    which    manage    and
integrate  a  computers capabilities
but  typically do not directly apply
them  in  the  performance  of tasks
that  benefit  the  user  The system
software   serves   the  application
which   in   turn  serves  the  user
Similar relationships apply in other
fields  For  example a shopping mall
does  not  provide the merchandise a
shopper   is  seeking  but  provides
space  and  services  for  retailers
that  serve the shopper A bridge may
similarly  support rail tracks which
support  trains  allowing the trains
to  transport passengers Application
software  applies  the  power  of  a
particular   computing  platform  or
system   software  to  a  particular
purpose  Some apps such as Microsoft
Office are available in versions for
several  different  platforms others
have  narrower  requirements and are
thus  called for example a Geography
application   for   Windows   or  an
Android application for education or

popular   application  arises  which
only runs on one platform increasing

programming  language  which  is  an
artificial   language   often   more
restrictive    or   demanding   than
natural    languages    but   easily
translated   by   the  computer  The

editDefinitions  The  ACM  Computing
Curricula  defined computing as In a
general  way we can define computing
to  mean  any  goaloriented activity
requiring    benefiting    from   or
creating  computers  Thus  computing
includes   designing   and  building
hardware  and software systems for a
wide  range  of  purposes processing
structuring   and  managing  various
kinds     of    information    doing
scientific  studies  using computers

information    relevant    to    any
particular  purpose  and  so  on The
list  is  virtually  endless and the
possibilities   are   vast   and  it
defines  five  subdisciplines of the
computing   field  Computer  Science
Computer   Engineering   Information
Systems  Information  Technology and
Software     Engineering     However
Computing  Curricula also recognizes
that   the   meaning   of  computing
depends  on  the  context  Computing
also  has  other  meanings  that are
more  specific  based on the context
in   which  the  term  is  used  For
example   an   information   systems
specialist   will   view   computing
somewhat differently from a software
engineer  Regardless  of the context
doing    computing   well   can   be
complicated  and  difficult  Because
society needs people to do computing
well  we must think of computing not
only  as  a profession but also as a
discipline  The  term  computing has
sometimes  been  narrowly defined as
in  a  ACM  report on Computing as a
Discipline    The    discipline   of
computing is the systematic study of
algorithmic  processes that describe
and   transform   information  their
theory  analysis  design  efficiency
implementation  and  application The
fundamental  question underlying all
computing is What can be efficiently
automated The term computing is also
synonymous    with    counting   and
calculating  In earlier times it was
used   in  reference  to  mechanical
computing  machines  editHistory  of
computing  Main  articles History of
computing  and Timeline of computing
The  history  of computing is longer
than   the   history   of  computing
hardware    and   modern   computing
technology  and includes the history
of  methods  intended  for  pen  and
paper or for chalk and slate with or
without  the aid of tables Computing
is    intimately    tied    to   the
representation  of  numbers But long
before  abstractions like the number
arose    there   were   mathematical
concepts  to  serve  the purposes of
civilization  These concepts include
onetoone correspondence the basis of
counting  comparison  to  a standard
used  for  measurement and the right
triangle  a  device  for  assuring a
right  angle The earliest known tool
for   use  in  computation  was  the
abacus  and  it  was thought to have
been  invented  in  Babylon circa BC
Its  original  style of usage was by
lines  drawn  in  sand  with pebbles
Abaci  of  a  more modern design are
still   used  as  calculation  tools
today   This  was  the  first  known
computer and most advanced system of
calculation  known to date preceding
Greek  methods by years editComputer
Main  articles  Computer  Outline of
computers  and  Glossary of computer
terms  A  computer is a machine that
manipulates  data according to a set
of  instructions  called  a computer
program    The    program   has   an
executable  form  that  the computer
can  use  directly  to  execute  the
instructions The same program in its
humanreadable   source   code   form
enables  a  programmer  to study and
develop  the  algorithm  Because the
instructions  can  be carried out in
different   types   of  computers  a
single  set  of  source instructions
converts   to  machine  instructions
according  to the central processing
unit   type  The  execution  process
carries  out  the  instructions in a
computer     program    Instructions
express  the  computations performed
by   the   computer   They   trigger
sequences  of  simple actions on the
executing   machine   Those  actions
produce  effects  according  to  the
semantics    of   the   instructions
editComputer  software  and hardware
Main  articles Software and Computer
hardware  Computer  software or just
software is a collection of computer
programs   and   related  data  that
provides    the   instructions   for
telling  a  computer  what to do and
how  to do it Software refers to one
or  more  computer programs and data
held  in the storage of the computer
for  some  purposes  In  other words
software   is   a  set  of  programs
procedures    algorithms   and   its
documentation   concerned  with  the
operation   of   a  data  processing
system Program software performs the
function    of    the   program   it
implements    either   by   directly
providing    instructions   to   the
computer  hardware  or by serving as
input  to  another piece of software
The  term  was coined to contrast to
the   old   term   hardware  meaning
physical   devices  In  contrast  to
hardware  software cannot be touched
Software is also sometimes used in a
more     narrow     sense    meaning
application  software only Sometimes
the  term includes data that has not
traditionally  been  associated with
computers  such  as  film  tapes and
records   editApplication   software
Main  article  Application  software
Application  software  also known as
an application or an app is computer
software  designed  to help the user
to  perform  specific tasks Examples
include      enterprise     software
accounting  software  office  suites
graphics  software and media players
Many   application   programs   deal
principally  with documents Apps may
be bundled with the computer and its
system  software or may be published
separately  Some users are satisfied
with the bundled apps and need never
install  one Application software is
contrasted  with system software and
middleware    which    manage    and
integrate  a  computers capabilities
but  typically do not directly apply
them  in  the  performance  of tasks
that  benefit  the  user  The system
software   serves   the  application
which   in   turn  serves  the  user
Similar relationships apply in other
fields  For  example a shopping mall
does  not  provide the merchandise a
shopper   is  seeking  but  provides
space  and  services  for  retailers
that  serve the shopper A bridge may
similarly  support rail tracks which
support  trains  allowing the trains
to  transport passengers Application
software  applies  the  power  of  a
particular   computing  platform  or
system   software  to  a  particular
purpose  Some apps such as Microsoft
Office are available in versions for
several  different  platforms others
have  narrower  requirements and are
thus  called for example a Geography
application   for   Windows   or  an
Android application for education or
Linux  gaming  Sometimes  a  new and
popular   application  arises  which
only runs on one platform increasing
the  desirability  of  that platform
This  is called a killer application

program    The    program   has   an
executable  form  that  the computer
can  use  directly  to  execute  the

or  more  computer programs and data
held  in the storage of the computer
for  some  purposes  In  other words
software   is   a  set  of  programs
procedures    algorithms   and   its
documentation   concerned  with  the

system Program software performs the
function    of    the   program   it
implements    either   by   directly
providing    instructions   to   the
computer  hardware  or by serving as
input  to  another piece of software
The  term  was coined to contrast to

shopper   is  seeking  but  provides
space  and  services  for  retailers
that  serve the shopper A bridge may
similarly  support rail tracks which
support  trains  allowing the trains

software  applies  the  power  of  a
particular   computing  platform  or
system   software  to  a  particular
purpose  Some apps such as Microsoft

Software     engineering    Computer
programming   in   general   is  the
process of writing testing debugging
and  maintaining the source code and
documentation  of  computer programs
This  source  code  is  written in a
programming  language  which  is  an
artificial   language   often   more
restrictive    or   demanding   than
natural    languages    but   easily
translated   by   the  computer  The
purpose  of programming is to invoke
the  desired behaviour customization
from  the  machine  The  process  of
writing  high  quality  source  code
requires   knowledge   of  both  the
applications domain and the computer
science  domain  The  highestquality
software is thus developed by a team
of   various   domain  experts  each
person  a specialist in some area of
development  But the term programmer
may  apply  to  a  range  of program
quality  from  hacker to open source
contributor  to  professional  And a
single  programmer  could do most or
all   of  the  computer  programming
needed  to  generate  the  proof  of
